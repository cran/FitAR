\title{ Box-Cox Analysis for a Time Series }
\description{
  The time series is converted to a vector and BoxCox.numeric is used.
}
\usage{
\method{BoxCox}{ts}(object, interval = c(-1, 1), ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{ a vector of time series values }
  \item{interval}{ interval to be searched }
  \item{\dots}{ optional arguments  }
}

\details{
For \eqn{\lambda \ne 0}{lambda!=0}, the Box-Cox transformation is of x is
\eqn{(x^\lambda - 1)/\lambda}{(x^lambda-1)/lambda}.
If the minimum data value is <= 0, a small positive constant, equal to
the negative of the minimum plus 0.25, is added to all the
data values.
}

\value{
No value returned. Graphical output produced as side-effect.
The plot shows relative likelihood function as well as the MLE and a confidence interval.

only for regression and analysis of variance. }

\section{Warning}{
It is important not to transform the data when fitting it with
AR since the optimal transformation would be found for the transformed
data -- not the original data. Normally this would not be a sensible thing
to do.
